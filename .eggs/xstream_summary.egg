🐔 XStream Library Egg Summary 🥚
---------------------------------
Date of Laying: 2025-09-08
Target: XStream Rust Library

PURPOSE 🎯
XStream is a sophisticated Rust library for stream processing and transformation, 
focusing on flexible token-based stream manipulation with advanced composability.

KEY ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS 🧱
1. Stream Types
   - Supports token-based streaming
   - Provides multiple transformation and manipulation strategies
   - Implements RSB (Reactive Stream Behavior) patterns

2. Core Modules
   - types: Core streaming type definitions
   - parse: Stream parsing utilities
   - gen: Stream generation capabilities
   - transform: Token stream transformations
   - fork: Stream splitting operations
   - merge: Stream combination strategies
   - gate: Stream filtering and state management

3. REAL Operations 🚀
   - real_fork: Advanced stream forking
   - real_gate: Sophisticated stream gating
   - real_merge: Intelligent stream merging

NOTABLE FEATURES 🌟
- Token-level stream processing
- Namespace-aware operations
- Flexible transformation strategies
- Composable stream manipulations

STREAMING STRATEGIES 🔄
- Fork Modes: By namespace, pattern
- Merge Strategies: Concatenation, collision policies
- Gate Modes: XOR, timed, stateful gates

PHILOSOPHICAL CHICKEN NOTE 🐓
"Just like sorting eggs in the coop, XStream sorts and transforms your data streams 
with precision and care!"
